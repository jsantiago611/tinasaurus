title: Stop deciding

Every morning when the alarm goes off, millions of people negotiate with themselves.

“Should I journal today?”

“Should I go to the gym today?”

Should I make those calls today?”

This negotiation - this daily decision tax we impose on ourselves - is exhausting. And expensive.

Here’s the thing about decisions: Make the important ones once, not every day.

When you decide once, you cut the friction. you remove the resistance. You silence the “lizard brain” (this is a Seth Godin term) that wants to keep you safe.

Seth Godin didn’t decide to blog today.

He decided to blog every day.

Once.

Once. That’s how many times you need to decide. Not every sunrise. Not every Monday. Not every time resistance whispers. Once.

And that’s the difference between pros like Seth Godin and amateurs like myself. Professionals make the decision once. Amateurs negotiate with themselves every single day.

Yes, the world changes. Markets shift. Customers evolve. But your commitment to showing up, to being a present parent, to leading with kindness - that’s non-negotiable.

What decision are you refusing to make once?

What would change if you did?
