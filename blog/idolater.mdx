SERMON EXCERPT FROM Children of the Light

Paul is talking about the fact that it’s possible to not be doing something externally wrong. That is, you may be doing a behavior that is externally in compliance with the law of God, but internally, for a motive that makes it sinful anyway, because idolatry is the first of the Ten Commandments: “Thou shalt have no other gods before me.”

That means, in brief, God is saying,

* “If there’s anything more important to you than me,
* anything that gives you more meaning in life than I do,
* anything that is a greater foundation for your sense of value and worth and significance than me,
* if there’s anything you love more than me,
* if there’s anything you center your life on more than me,

…that’s a god. It’s a religion.”

Even if it’s a good thing, even if your children are more important than God, or your career is more important than God, or some very noble political or social cause is more important than God, it will eat you alive, because anything you put in the place of God will fail to give you what only the true God can give you. You’ll be driven into the ground by it. You’ll be paralyzed by fears if something goes wrong with it. You’ll be despondent.

Do you see how comprehensive the definition is? Paul says if you’re going to live as a Christian, you’re going to have to understand what sin is, and he gives us this comprehensive understanding of sin being [external disobedience](https://www.notion.so/fruitless-deeds-of-darkness-d02d7c5448d94a1cb7ed8cd9e788fea4?pvs=21) to the law of God, and internal idolatry.
