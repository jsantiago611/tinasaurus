## How does Genesis move the story of the Bible along?

Genesis is the beginning of the story of the Bible.

The storyline of the overall Bible is: Creation, Fall, Redemption, and Restoration.

Genesis has more chapters of the storyline than any other book:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Creation" value="creation" children="The world is created in Genesis 1 and 2." />

  <TabItem
    label="Fall"
    value="fall"
    children="In Genesis 3, human beings turn away from God, the good world falls into corruption, and humans are exiled. 

    For the first 11 chapters, things are getting worse and worse. This section is mainly about Creation and Fall.  There is very little about redemption here (with the exception of a few spots, like God graciously putting a mark on Cain so that he is not killed). 

    So, in Chapters 3-11, we see sin and the corruption of sin getting worse and worse. "
