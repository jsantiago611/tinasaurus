    label="The Fall"
    value="the_fall"
    children="In Genesis 3, human beings turn away from God, the good world falls into corruption, and humans are exiled. 

    For the first 11 chapters, things are getting worse and worse. This section is mainly about &#x22;Creation&#x22; and &#x22;Fall&#x22;.  There is very little about redemption here (with the exception of a few spots, like God graciously putting a mark on Cain so that he is not killed). 

    So, in Chapters 3-11, we see sin and the corruption of sin getting worse and worse. "
