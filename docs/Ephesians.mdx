> 1 Follow God’s example, therefore, as dearly loved children 2 and walk in the way of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God. 3 But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God’s holy people. 4 Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving.

## Children of the Light | Eph. 5:5-21

### Know sin and walk in obedience

> 5 For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person—such a person is an  [idolater ](https://tinasaurus-beta.vercel.app/blog/idolater "idolater")—has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. 6 Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God's wrath comes on those who are disobedient. 7 Therefore do not be partners with them. 8 For you were once darkness , but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light 9 (for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness and truth) 10 and find out what pleases the Lord. 11 Have nothing to do with the  fruitless deeds of darkness , but rather expose them. 12 It is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret. 13 But everything exposed by the light becomes visible—and everything that is illuminated becomes a light. 14 This is why it is said:\
> \
> “Wake up, sleeper,
> rise from the dead,
> and Christ will shine on you.”

### Know the time and walk in wisdom

> 15 Be very careful, then, how you live—not as unwise but as wise, 16 [making the most of every opportunity](https://gil-study-bible.vercel.app/making-the-most-of-every-opportunity ""), because the days are evil. 17 Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord’s will is. 

### Know the Lord and walk with joy

> 18 [Do not get drunk](https://gil-study-bible.vercel.app/do-not-get-drunk "") on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be [filled with the Spirit](https://gil-study-bible.vercel.app/filled-with-the-spirit ""), 19 speaking to one another with psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit. Sing and [make music](https://gil-study-bible.vercel.app/make-music "") from your heart to the Lord, 20 always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.21 Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.

    children="Prayer: Our Father, we thank you for this kind of helicopter ride over this passage in which we see how much there is involved with living a Christian life. How revolutionary it would be if we understood sin, understood wisdom, and knew the joy the Spirit can give us so we are also walking about always sweetly singing to ourselves, full of joy, and no one knowing quite for what, always having somebody invisible conversing with us.

    Oh Lord, we really do long for that kind of joyful life, and we ask that you would make it more a reality in our lives as we take up the bread and the cup, for there you so often meet with your people over your table. We pray this in Jesus’ name, amen."
