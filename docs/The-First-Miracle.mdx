## Scripture Selection

> **Acts 3:2-8**: 2 And a man lame from birth was being carried up, who was placed at the temple gate called “the Beautiful Gate” every day so he could beg for money from those going into the temple courts. 3 When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple courts, he asked them for money. 4 Peter looked directly at him (as did John) and said, “Look at us!” 5 So the lame man paid attention to them, expecting to receive something from them. 6 But Peter said, “I have no silver or gold, but what I do have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, stand up and walk!” 7 Then Peter took hold of him by the right hand and raised him up, and at once the man's feet and ankles were made strong. 8 He jumped up, stood and began walking around, and he entered the temple courts with them, walking and leaping and praising God.

> **Acts 3:13-23: **13 The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our forefathers, has glorified his servant Jesus, whom you handed over and rejected in the presence of Pilate after he had decided to release him. 14 But you rejected the Holy and Righteous One and asked that a man who was a murderer be released to you. 15 You killed the Originator of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this fact we are witnesses! 16 And on the basis of faith in Jesus' name, his very name has made this man—whom you see and know—strong. The faith that is through Jesus has given him this complete health in the presence of you all. 17 And now, brothers, I know you acted in ignorance, as your rulers did too. 18 But the things God foretold long ago through all the prophets—that his Christ would suffer—he has fulfilled in this way. 19 Therefore repent and turn back so that your sins may be wiped out, 20 so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and so that he may send the Messiah appointed for you—that is, Jesus. 21 This one heaven must receive until the time all things are restored, which God declared from times long ago through his holy prophets. 22 Moses said, 'The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brothers. You must obey him in everything he tells you. 23 Every person who does not obey that prophet will be destroyed and thus removed from the people.'

## Introduction to the Sermon

Acts 3 records the continuation of Jesus’ ministry through the apostles’ first miracle. 

In our day and age, what should we even make of the idea of miracles? Were they simply displays of power meant to draw the attention of others? In what way do miracles point to something more profound, deeper and far more significant? 

This message shows in his sermon how that first miracle points upward, points forward, points inward, and points downward. (Introduction from [Gospel in Life](https://gospelinlife.com/downloads/the-first-miracle-6183/ "Gospel In Life"))

## Outline & Excerpts

### Point #1: The First Miracle points upwards 

### Point #2: The First Miracle points forward

### Point #3: The First Miracle points inward

### Point #4: The First Miracle points downward 

### Conclusion

All of the miracles actually do the same thing. 

* They point upward: You can trust the gospel is from Jesus. 
* They point forward: We must be an enemy of suffering in this world because we’re on the winning side, because God is against it. 
* They point inward: See what you really need. What you really need is a personal relationship with God through Jesus Christ. You need to have your sins forgiven. Deal with your sin. It’s more the immediate need than your suffering. 
* They point downward: Look at what Jesus Christ did for you. Now go and do likewise.
