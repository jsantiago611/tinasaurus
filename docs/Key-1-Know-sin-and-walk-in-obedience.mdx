title: 'Key #1: Know sin and walk in obedience'
---

The first part of the passage, from verses 5–14 … To live as a Christian you have to know sin (know what it is) and walk in obedience. In this whole passage, Paul is saying to live as Christians we must have a sense of the
horror, of the evil, of the danger of sin.
He gets that across by saying there have to be four things you know about sin if you’re going to live a Christian life.

**There are four things Paul tells you about sin.** Christians cannot live an appropriate life if...

1. Christians cannot live an appropriate life if they don’t understand the definition of it and how comprehensive it is
2. Christians cannot live an appropriate life if they don’t understand the power of it still in human nature
3. Christians cannot live an appropriate life if they don’t understand the guilt of it
4. Christians cannot live an appropriate life if they don’t understand the grace toward it

### The Definition of Sin

The first one is in verse 11 where he defines sin. He says, “Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness …” That’s one way to understand sin. That means externally to disobey the law of God, to disobey the things God says in his Word he wants us to do.
There’s an example of it up in the very first verse: “For of this you can
be sure: No immoral, impure, or greedy person … has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.” There are actually two case studies there of disobedience. The first is immoral, impure (and the word immoral there is the Greek word porneia, from which we get our word pornography, and it’s a word that means sexual immorality).


The second case is greed. Why would Paul choose just those two
examples of ways of disobeying the law of God? I think they get across the comprehensiveness of the law of God. There are many churches in this country that actually say what the Bible says about sex is obsolete, but what it says about greed, materialism, injustice, and oppression is absolutely right and should be heeded.


There are other churches in this country that put a lot of emphasis on
denouncing sexual immorality and making a pretty big show of it but at the same time essentially ignoring what the Bible says about greed and the importance of involvement with the poor and not spending too much of your money on yourself.
In other words, the law of God is so comprehensive it’s very difficult for people of particular temperaments to hold it all together. We have a tendency to either nullify or ignore part of it and lift up other parts. 

The law of God, though, is very comprehensive. All those things are wrong. Sin is disobedience in your behavior to the law of God, but it’s not just a matter of external behavior. Sin also has to do with internal motive. Paul brings that out in the very same verse.
In verse 5, he says, “No immoral, impure, or greedy person—such a man is an idolater—has any inheritance in the kingdom of … God.” 

There Paul is talking about the fact that it’s possible to not be doing something externally wrong. That is, you may be doing a behavior that is externally in compliance with the law of God, but internally, for a motive that makes it sinful anyway, because idolatry is the first of the Ten Commandments: “Thou shalt have no other gods before me.”
That means, in brief, God is saying, “If there’s anything more important to you than me, anything that gives you more meaning in life than I do, anything that is a greater foundation for your sense of value and worth and significance than me, if there’s anything you love more than me, if there’s anything you center your life on more than me, that’s a god. It’s a religion.”


Even if it’s a good thing, even if your children are more important than God, or your career is more important than God, or some very noble political or social cause is more important than God, it will eat you alive, because anything you put in the place of God will fail to give you what only the true God can give you. You’ll be driven into the ground by it. You’ll be paralyzed by fears if something goes wrong with it. You’ll be despondent.


Do you see how comprehensive the definition is? Paul says if you’re
going to live as a Christian, you’re going to have to understand what sin is, and he gives us this comprehensive understanding of sin being external disobedience to the law of God, and internal idolatry. But he doesn’t stop there.


He also wants you to see the power of sin in the human heart, because he doesn’t just say in verse 11, “Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness …” He doesn’t just say that, because those are sinful behaviors and activities. He then says in verse 8, “For you were once darkness …”


Here he’s talking about human nature, and he’s saying something I think most people today would say is just too strong.
He says human beings do not just do deeds of darkness. They don’t just do bad things. They are darkness in their inmost being. That’s human nature. They are darkness. Some people say, “Well, that’s too negative.


That’s one of the things I don’t like about the Bible. It’s just too negative about human nature.” Really? I will not forget it. I’ve been trying to find a clip of it on the Internet, but I can’t find it. Some years ago, Mike Wallace interviewed a concentration camp survivor named Yehiel Dinur. The reason he interviewed him was …
Some of you know in the Nazi Holocaust (the slaughter of Jews in Nazi Germany) one of the architects of the Holocaust was a man named Adolph Eichmann. He disappeared right after World War II and went into hiding, but he was caught, and in 1961 he was put on public trial. In the trial, eye-witness survivors who had seen him doing the things he did, who were still alive, were brought in to witness against him and to testify. Yehiel Dinur was one of them. When Yehiel Dinur went into the court room (and this was caught on film), when he saw Eichmann he started to sob uncontrollably, and he collapsed. The judge had to pound the gavel because there was great disorder in the court, and it was very, very dramatic.


Mike Wallace showed Yehiel Dinur the clip of how he just collapsed,
and how he just melted down. He said to him, “What happened? What were you feeling at that point? Was it post-traumatic stress? Was it that you were just filled with rage to see this man?” Yehiel 

Dinur said something I just think absolutely startled and flummoxed Mike Wallace. He essentially said, “When I walked in and I saw him, I suddenly realized he was no demon. He was no superman. He was an ordinary human being exactly like me, and suddenly I became terrified about myself. I saw
that I am capable of the same things.” That’s why he collapsed. I think
Mike Wallace was saying, “What?” He looked into his own heart and he
saw darkness.
Hannah Arendt was covering the trial as a journalist and then wrote her
well-known essay, “Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of
Evil,” was making the same point. She was saying what we want to do in
order to defend ourselves is to say about the Nazis, “These must have been
monsters. These must have been sub-people. They weren’t like us. They
must have been monsters to be able to do that.” That way we can say we
would never do that.
She says by saying they’re sub-people, that’s exactly what they did to the
Jews. Oh, no. They’re just people, just like us, and we do not want to admit
what we’re capable of, that the seeds in our hearts are there. If they were
properly watered and properly fertilized, you could do all the same things
they did. There’s a darkness in the middle of the human heart. Paul says
Christians are not living in denial about that. Many other people are. If
you’re going to live a Christian life, you’ve got to see not just the definition
of sin but the power of sin in the human heart.
But thirdly, it’s not just that. If you’re going to live a Christian life, you
also have to see the guilt of sin, because Paul does the no-no here, at least in
New York (not that he ever was here, but even these words are very much a
no-no in New York). In verse 6 he says, “Let no one deceive you with
empty words, for because of such things \[meaning sin] God’s wrath comes
on those who are disobedient. Therefore do not be partners with them.”
We don’t like the idea of a wrathful God, partly because we
misunderstand the term wrath there. We’re thinking of somebody who is
losing his temper and can’t control his emotions, but the word wrath in the
Bible (in fact, the word wrath in ancient literature) is talking about subtle
judicial condemnation. God’s wrath lies on sin because sin deserves
punishment. That’s the idea, because sin incurs guilt, and if you sin you are
guilty. You’re not just messed up. You’re guilty, and it deserves punishment.
That’s what it means to say God’s wrath is upon all sin.
People really push back on this a lot. I’ve talked to people over the years
who’ve said something like, “You know, the Bible’s teaching on this just
doesn’t make sense to me.” I’ve had people say to me, “There are some
people who deserve God’s wrath. There are nasty people. There are bad
people out there, the Nazis, the Holocaust, you know, and they deserve
God’s wrath. But most people are good people. I’m a good person. I’m not
religious, but I’m a good person, and isn’t that what’s important?”
Think about this illustration. Imagine an old widowed woman who has
one child. As she raises him she teaches him to always tell the truth, always
work hard, and always care for the poor. Honesty, industry, and charity. She
teaches him how she wants him to live, and he listens to her. Then, when he
comes of age, she is a very poor woman, but she scrapes together her
meager savings and what income she can, and she puts him through college,
and he graduates.
Now imagine that after he graduates he never talks to her again. He
sends her a Christmas card, but he doesn’t answer her e-mails. He doesn’t
answer her phone calls. He doesn’t answer her letters. He doesn’t talk to
her, but he’s good. He does everything she wants. He tells the truth, he
works hard, and he cares for the poor. He says, “Hey, I’m doing what she
wants. Isn’t that good enough?”
What would you say to him if you knew him? You’d say, “No! It is not
acceptable simply to live a good life and ignore a relationship with the one
person to whom you owe everything.” Now, if there is a God, and you say,
“Well, I’m not religious, but I’m living a good life. Isn’t that what’s
important?” the answer is no.
It’s condemnable. It’s as culpable as that young man would be. If there is
a God to whom you owe everything, then just to live a good life in general
and not live for God, and not make your relationship with him the central
thing because you owe him everything, means you’re guilty. It’s
condemnable, and a Christian understands that.
Here’s what’s so interesting. There are four things Paul tells you about
sin. Christians cannot live an appropriate life if, first, they don’t understand
the definition of it and how comprehensive it is, second, they don’t
understand the power of it still in human nature, and third, they don’t
understand the guilt of it.
Lastly, go back to verse 8 and look at what he says, “For you were once
darkness …” He’s talking to Christians. “… but now you are light in the
Lord.” You are light! What’s that metaphor mean? It’s not that hard to tell.
What does the word light mean in the Bible? Paul actually tells you in the
next verse it represents goodness, righteousness, and truthfulness.
What in the world, after everything he’s just said? How could any
Christian, knowing all the other things Paul just talked to them about, say,
“Look at me. Look at all my goodness. Look at all my truthfulness. Am I
not so brilliant and beautiful in my moral excellence that you need to almost
wear sunglasses to look at me?” Why would any Christian say, “I am
light”?
The answer is you can say it if you’re careful about the prepositional
phrase. It means everything. It links us back to the first part of the book of
Ephesians. It says, “… you were once darkness, but now you are light in the
Lord.” And in the first part of Ephesians, God says the moment you receive
Christ, the moment you believe in him as your Savior, you are united to
him. You are put in him.
In a sense, you’re put in him so although in yourself you are still
darkness and you’re still flawed, in Christ God sees you as brilliant, as
beautiful, as acceptable, as goodness and righteousness and truth. Isn’t that
astounding? You say, “How can that be?” Well, that’s what we were
spending a lot of time on in the first part of the series.
One more thing. Imagine a girl, and she’s poor and she’s plain. She
doesn’t have a penny, and she’s not very attractive. But the great prince falls
in love with her, and he puts his love upon her, and he takes her to be his
wife. In the great wedding ceremony he brings her to himself and makes a
vow, and do you know what happens in that ceremony?
They’re united. Do you know what that means? The minute before they
are united legally by a vow, she’s poor, and immediately, she’s rich. She’s
got money. She’s got money to burn. Not only that, he has decked her in the
most beautiful jewels and the finest garments in the world that money can
buy. Though in herself she’s plain, she’s a vision of loveliness.
You see, in herself she’s poor and she’s plain. But in the love of her
prince, she’s light. She’s beautiful. She’s wealthy. That’s just a dim hint of
what it means to be a Christian. Paul says you have to keep these things all
in balance. I told you, of the three points, this is the long one, but I want
you to see why it’s long and why it’s so important.
If you live a life only filled with guilt (“I’m so dark, I’m so awful, I have
all this bad stuff in my life and I’m a mess, and everything I do makes me
guilty”) you’re not going to live the Christian life you should. Weirdly
enough, if you hate yourself, if you go around feeling self-loathing, you will
not live an obedient life. You’ll just give in to temptation.
On the other hand, if you say, “Well, I’m fine. I’m accepted. God has
forgiven me, so it really doesn’t matter how I live,” no! This whole passage
is Paul saying, “Sin, avoid it. Flee it! Have nothing to do with it. It’s awful.
Expose it! Call it what it is.” There’s a balance here of knowing you’re light
in the Lord, and because you’re light in the Lord you want nothing to do
with sin.
The balance perfectly comes out in one sentence in our Westminster
Confession, which is the Presbyterians’ historic summary of what they
believe the Bible teaches. In the Westminster Confession 15, part 4, is one
sentence that says, “As there is no sin so small, but it deserves damnation;
so there is no sin so great, that it can bring damnation upon those who truly
repent.”
Sin is that bad and terrible, and grace is that free and available. Just as
there is no sin so small but it deserves damnation (condemnation), so there
is no sin so great it can bring condemnation on those who truly repent. If
you live your life in the light of those two balancing truths, you will have an
incentive to live in a godly way. You will be able to pick yourself up when
you fail without destroying yourself and hating yourself for 10 years. You
will, by knowing sin, walk in obedience.
