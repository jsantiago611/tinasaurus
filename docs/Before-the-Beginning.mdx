description: 'Genesis 1:1-3'

> 1:1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 1:2 Now the earth was without shape and empty, and darkness was over the surface of the watery deep, but the Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the water. 1:3 God said, “Let there be light.” And there was light!

<Admonition type="note" title="Sermon Notes: Before the Beginning">
  We see three things before the beginning:
  **Before the beginning, There was God.**
  There are unfortunate implications to not believing in God:

  * If you do not believe in God, you forfeit the right to say what is right and what is wrong.
  * If you do not believe in God, you will not live consistently.
  * If you do not believe in God, you may end up living for the opinions of others.
